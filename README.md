# CDID Fishing Macro
mancing mania, mantap! THIS MACRO ONLY WORKS IN NIGHTTIME INGAME (18:00-06:00)<br/>
currently this only works on windows, mac/linux support is unlikely unless this turns into a real minigame

## Prerequisites
1. have python in ur pc https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. also run this on your terminal: pip install pyautogui keyboard numpy pillow pywin32

## Installation
1. click cdidmacrofisch.py above
2. click 'Download raw file'

## Help
If macro feels too janky, edit aggressive_threshold value in line 185
   
## Contribution
this is currently a solo project, and it'll stay that way for a long time. unless, you can convince me otherwise. let me know in Discord (@cn3z).
